To run the code:

run "python tagger.py <task> <embedding> <embedding type>
where task is either "ner" or "pos", embedding is either "pre" (for pre-trained embedding) or "new" (no pre-train), and embedding type is "simple" (for just word embeddings)
"presuf" (with word+prefixes+sufixes embedding) or "chars" for word+char embedding.

(we have just one main file)

Note there are python files in the "data" folder as well.
