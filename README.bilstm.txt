To run the code:

Put the folders in the 'data' folder (i.e. data/ner/...). Then run the files with ner/pos for the 'task' argument. The model file w.r.t. the current directory.
The graphs will be created automatically, <task>_accuracy, <task>_loss for the train, and <task>.txt for the predictions.
(a different file, create_graphs.py, is used to create the graphs)
