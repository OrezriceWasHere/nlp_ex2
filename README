To run the files, simply run "python <filename>". When a part have to be solved for two tasks (ner, pos) supply as an argument the task name (ner/pos).
Specifically, for "tagger1", supply the command line argument 'pre' as the second argument if you want to use pre embedding.
Most of the additional files are used by most of the "main" files.
Note there are python files in the "data" folder.
